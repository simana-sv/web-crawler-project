run my website:
npx http-server -p 10000 html
1st fetched html- npm start will fetch if i print html in console
2nd search for elements(find and get all the links available on the website)
crawl the links
ignore the duplicate links
download images
stay on same page {stay on the host}

handle absolute vs relative links?
